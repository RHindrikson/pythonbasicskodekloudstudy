## Pythin literal basics
#   integers (numbers that do not have fractions)
#    - Decimal
#     - Octal: numbers that starts with 0o  (zero and a "o" letter)
#     -   ex:   0o123   >>>     1 - 8^2 = 64 ->  64 * 1  = 64
#                               2 - 8^1 = 8  ->   8 * 2  = 16      >>>  64 + 16 + 3 = 83
#                               3 - 8^0 = 1  ->   1 * 3  =  3 
#
#       - Hexadecimal: numbers that starts with 0x  (zero and a "x" letter)
#     -   ex:   0o123   >>>     1 - 16^2 = 256 ->  256 * 1 = 256
#                               2 - 16^1 = 16  ->   16 * 2 = 32      >>>  256 + 32 + 3 = 291
#                               3 - 16^0 = 1   ->    1 * 3 =  3 
#       - Floating point: no empty decimal fraction
#           can be written with "e" for economical representation form 1e10
#
#       - Strings: within double or single quotes
#           for quotes needed inside, use on type for the inside and other to set the string
#           or the same type in both but using the scape charactere  "Hello \"programmers\" !!"
#                            
#       - Booleans: True (also represented by the number 1) and False (also represented bythe number 0)     
#
